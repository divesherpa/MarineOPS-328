# OpenOBS-328

OpenOBS-328 is the successor to the [OpenOBS](http://www.github.com/tedlanghorst/openobs) project, an opensource, field-deployable, optical backscatter sensor (OBS). OBSs are used for measuring the turbidity, or clarity, of water for environmental monitoring. Here you will the find folders for the PCB assembly files, sensor firmware, and processing scripts.

**For more information on building, deploying, and using the sensor, visit our [documentation page!](https://tedlanghorst.github.io/OpenOBS-328/docs)**
